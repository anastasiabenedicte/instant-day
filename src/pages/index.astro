        October 18 is Instant Day - a day all about celebrating instant
        photography. So get out your Polaroid, Instax or whatever instant
        photography camera you are using, and show us your instants. Instant Day
        isn’t really a photo competition, it’s more a homage to good old
        analogue, instant photography - everybody who participates are
        winners:-) <br />But: We do have a nice prize for one lucky instant
        photographer!

        Why instant Photography?

          Instant Photography is a testament to life: It all started back in the
          1940’s with a 3 year old kid. She wanted to see her fathers images
          right away. The father, Edwin Land, embarked on a mission: To invent
          instant photography. Half a decade later, Edwin Land launched Instant
          photography and established the Polaroid brand.

          Instant photography turned into big business in the 70’s and 80’s,
          until the digital era almost killed the industry. The massive amount
          of time wasted on the small screens have spurred a counterreaction:
          Analogue, off-line experiences have become popular again. And instant
          photography is just that: An analogue, life-affirming and tactile
          photography experience. So let’s celebrate life, and make memories:-)

        The Polaroid collection was a large collection of instant photographs
        assembled by the Polaroid corporation and featured work from a lot of
        famous photographers. The collection was split into various parts and
        put on auction when the Polaroid corporation went into bankruptcy in
        2008. Luckily, you can find books with photographs from the collection,
        for instance The Polaroid Book by Steve Crist and Barbara Hitchcock. <br
        /><br />Dan Isaac Wallin is a swedish art photographer, who uses large
        format and vintage polaroid cameras for his work. His work hangs in
        numerous houses as posters. <br /><br />Mette Kelter is a danish art
        photographer, who often experiments with deliberate destruction of the
        chemical process in instant photos. One of the key words here is
        unpredictability in the work process, which leads to interesting and
        unique artworks. <br /><br />Maripol is a french
        artist/photographer/film producer. Her claim to fame was in the 1980’s,
        where she photographed famous people with a Polaroid SX-70. Her
        photographs are still very influential in the fashion industry.
